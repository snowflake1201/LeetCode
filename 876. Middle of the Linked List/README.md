## Description:  
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.  

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.  

 

### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: [3,4,5]  
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.  
### Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
Output: [4,5,6]  
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.  
 

### Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].  
1 <= Node.val <= 100
