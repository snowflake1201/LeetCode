# Description:  
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
  
 

## Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]  
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]    
## Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: [2,3,1]    
## Example 3:  

Input: root = []  
Output: []  
 
  
## Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
