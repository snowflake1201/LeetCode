## Description:
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]  
Output: [1,2,5]    
## Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]  
Output: [2,3]  
    
### Constraints:  
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
