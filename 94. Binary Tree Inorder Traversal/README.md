## Description:  
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.  
### Example 1:  

  
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]  
Output: [1,3,2]  
### Example 2:  
  
Input: root = []  
Output: []  
### Example 3:  
  
Input: root = [1]  
Output: [1]  
 
  
### Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
   

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
